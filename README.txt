This is just a personal website to showcase my resume.

Notes:

    CNAME is the verified domain name that is attached to the website
        In this case it is 'cameronpersaud.us'.
        However, it could be whatever domain that a person owns.

    File 'index(0).html' was the first root file that was used to test the site.
        It was writen by ChatGPT and allowed for the user to display their .html file 
        on their website. Instead of deleting it, it was just archived in the site for 
        further use.

    File 'icon.png' is the site's icon photo. This could be any photo ranging from a lamp to
    a picture of someone's face. 
        Typically the icon is formated to be 32x32 pixels for the website.
        
        The reference code for this icon is linked in the header of the site.
            "<link rel="icon" href="/icon.png" sizes="32x32">"

            The href is "http://cameronpersaud.us/icon.png" for the entire link. However, 
            since the site itself is already referenced through context, only the extension leading
            to the file itself is needed.

    File 'index.html' is the sites directory file. 
        This .html file is the direct file that the complier and the host server uses to display the
        site itself.
